# What is this wsgi-calc?

This is a simple web calculator. It will only do addition,subtraction, division and multiplication.

## Why?

Because it was my homework.

## How does it work?

It's quite stupid really. You just put the numbers you wish to perform math with into the url itself.

Each math function has its separate URL:

http://localhost:8080/multiply/ <br>
http://localhost:8080/divide/ <br>
http://localhost:8080/add/ <br>
http://localhost:8080/subtract/<br>

If you wanted to multiply 5 and 5, your URL would look like this:<br>
http://localhost:8080/multiply/5/5

## What if I have questions?
Do you really?

## No :(
That's what I thought.

## What new features are on the horizon?
Eventually I would like there to be a form on the page and you just enter the numbers and press the button of whatever math you want done.
